### Instructions from Spinndle
This is a react exersize based on a feature we have just made. Teachers wanted to be able to organize students in a classroom into groups, in order to assign different projects to different abilities. 

Please use the object named studentList in App.js to create a feature that organizes students into groups. Here are some constraints:

- Each student must be in a group on submit
- Teachers must be able to add or remove additional groups
- A submit button should console.log an array of groups that could be used by a backend

Keep it as simple as you want, as we respect your time, but state any assumptions/next steps. See possible wireframes in the public folder, but feel free to create it however you would like!

Instuctions for running this project can be seen below. Please clone this repo and fork it with your changes! (Or just grab the data from App.js and create your own repo, whatever is easier.)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
